[section Preface]
The Numerical Template Toolbox (__NT2__) is an open source C++ library aimed at easing the development
of high-performance numerical computing applications.

It does so with a high-level __MATLAB__-like syntax, which facilitates the transition from prototype
to finished product.

Thanks to C++ meta-programming techniques, __NT2__ can generate highly optimized code for a
variety of architectures on par with that of hand-written C code, and is able to leverage
the different kinds of parallelism found in modern hardware, such as SIMD, multi-core and cluster systems.

[classref a] is a very nice class.
